# Operating_Systems_banker_algorithm
### Compiling
```
This program uses three other classes named Banker, Naive, and Tasks.
So when compiling, do: 

javac Main.java Banker.java Naive.java Tasks.java
```

### Running

```
java Main (input file name)

** input file name is from input-01 to input-13
```
<br>

For instance, 
```
java Main input-01

and do not put .txt extension at the end of the input file name to run without getting an error
```
Thank you!
